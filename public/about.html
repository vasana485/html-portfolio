<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am writing this letter of motivation because I want to study at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University on the Bachelor's programme Multimedia Design. I have the relevant ambitions to enter the university. I know that Vilnius TECH is the largest educational and research institution in Lithuania, it's a leader in teaching of engineering and science. The university innovates educational and scientific potential, and it's a place where scientific discovers and research are widely implemented..</p>

<p>I've finished my secondary education with an average grade point of 10.4/12. At school, I took part in competitions in drawing, English and biology, and it was this experience that taught me to always see my work through. I also consider my great achievement to be participation and prizes in scientific works of the Small Academy of Sciences (a Ukrainian programme for students who have the opportunity to participate in research, development and invention work in various fields of science, technology, culture and art) in English and biology, and it is this experience that taught me to always see my work through. I have always been drawing as long as I can remember. I also almost graduated from Art School and I'm keen on drawing and learning new programs, I`ve started to work on Adobe Creator, Adobe Photoshop and Mathcad and other programs to learn computer skills. I'm sure in my ability of fast learning in new software programs and technologies as needed, and I'm looking forward to the challenge of mastering new tools and techniques. </p>
<p>After finishing my secondary education, I entered Kyiv Polytechnic University to study Publishing and Printing, which is slightly related to Multimedia Design, however it would be very interesting and useful for me to improve my IT prospects. I am diligent, resilient, and adaptable, and I'm able to thrive in high-pressured situations. I am also strongly motivated and committed to my work, and I take great pride in my ability to produce high-quality results.I know that our future depends on IT technologies, and specialists in this field make our lives easier. Unfortunately the war has been started by russians against my country, and during studying for more than six months in the midst of constant uncertainty, anxiousness and black outs, I realised that I wasn't capable of continuing my study like the majority part of Ukrainian children.</p>
<p>Over the next four years, I want to gain a deeper understanding of computer design and transmission of digital information. However, firstly I want to achieve experience as a student and reach my goals at the university, and then I wish I would work for a company which will develop and innovate in the digital sphere nowadays.
  I expect to get from my studies mastery of leading software for computer graphics products and acquire information technology computer design and transfer of digital information knowledge.
  It's hard to feel safe and be in classes at the same time in the midst of constant uncertainty and anxiousness, so I hope I will have a chance to study at the University because it gives me hope and opportunities.</p>
